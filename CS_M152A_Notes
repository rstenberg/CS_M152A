Overview:
	1. Resemblance to C: case sensitive, same style comments, operators, etc.
	2. Two standards: Verilog-1995, 2001, both supported by ISE
	3. VHDL is the other widely used HDL

Functions served by Verilog:
	1. Describe your digital logic design in high-level way instead of using schematics (synthesizeable code)
	2. Model elements that interact with your design (behavioral models/testbenches)

Data Types:
	1. wire
		Models basic wire that holds transient values
		Only wires can be used on LHS of continuous assign statement
	2. reg
		Anything that stores a value 
		Only regs can be used on LHS of non-continuous assign statement

Data Values:
	1. Values: 1,0,x/X (unknown),z/Z (high impedance)
	2. Radices: d(decimal), h(hex), o(octal), b(binary)
	3. Format: <size>'<radix><value>			// Notes -> size is in bits
	Example:
		8'h7B	// 'h = hex radix

Operators:
	Bitwise:
		~ not 
		& and
		| or
		^ xor
		~^ nor
	Reduction:
		bitwise operation on a single operand to produce a one bit result
	Logical:
		output one but result
		example: a&&b == (a AND b)
	Arithmetic: +,-,*,/,% (mod, takes the sign of operand 1)
	Shift:
		Logical -> replace with 0's (<<, >>)
		Arithmetic -> replace with most significant bit (<<<, >>>)
	Conditional: sel ? a : b         <--- if sel then a, otherwise b
	Concatentation: {a,b}
	Replication: {n{m}}
	Assignment:
		Blocking: = assignment immediate, happens first (combinational logic)
		Non-blocking: <= assignments deffered until all right hand sides have been evaluated (like register or flip-flop -> sequential logic)

Modules:
	Inputs/outputs = wires by default
	Concurrent logic blocks:
		1. Continuous assignments
		2. Always blocks (either sequanetial or combinatorial)
			Sensitivity list: 
				Level sensitive: changes to any signal in this list will invoke the always block (combinational)
					Shorthand for any right hand value: (@*)
					ex: always @*
				Edge sensitive: specified singal edges with invoke always block (sequential)
					ex: always @ (posedge clk or posedge reset)
		3. Initial blocks (only used in behavioral modeling)
		4. Forever blocks (only used in behavioral modeling)
